# Printerutils
A few utilities to reposition printer, from MSXDOS prompt.
I had a FAX-120 dot matrix printer, but codes were pretty standard then I guess.

- ACCPRT [source](./ACCPRT.GEN.TXT)
- ELITE [source](./ELITE.GEN.TXT)
- NLQOFF [source](./NLQOFF.GEN.TXT)
- NLQON [source](./NLQOFF.GEN.TXT)
- PICA [source](./PICA.GEN.TXT)

Conversion is done in Linux CLI with:
```bash
expand -t "8"
```
