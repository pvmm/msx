# MSX
This repository contains the sources and other stuff I made for MSX between 1985 and about 1995.
Many of them have been published in
[MSX Computer Magazine](https://msxcomputermagazine.nl/).

## Compiler
The compiler I used was Hisoft Devpac 80
(see [cpcwiki](http://www.cpcwiki.eu/index.php/Hisoft_Devpac_80)
or [Generation MSX](https://www.generation-msx.nl/software/hisoft/devpac80/2494/))

The tap stops were sometimes in strange places in the source (.GEN) files. This is why there is always a .GEN.TXT
file in which the tabs are converted to spaces.
